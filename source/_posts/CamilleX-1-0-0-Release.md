We have released CamilleX version 1.0.0. This is a rebranding of the existing XEvent-B feature.

CamilleX provides text editors for XContexts and XMachines which then compiled automatically to Rodin Event-B contexts and machines. It also supports extensions such as the *machine inclusion* mechanism. More information about CamilleX is available from the Event-B Wiki (http://wiki.event-b.org/index.php/CamilleX).

A basic tutorial is available in the user manual and also as a cheatsheet within Rodin.

Note that the Rodin Event-B contexts and machines are over-written by the CamilleX compilers. As a result, **DO NOT USE** CamilleX if you plan to use modelling extensions such as iUML-B state-machines and class diagrams. Modelling extensions will be addressed in future release of CamilleX.

Please report any issues on the development page https://github.com/eventB-Soton/XEventB.
